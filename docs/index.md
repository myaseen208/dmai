## Overview

**dmai** builds monetary aggregates from their components (currency,
demand deposits, savings and time deposits, …) by the methods of index
number theory:

- [`dmai()`](https://myaseen208.com/dmai/reference/dmai.md): the Divisia
  index of Barnett (1980), which weights every component by its share in
  the expenditure on monetary services priced by its user cost (Barnett
  1978); also the variant with simple growth rates (Hancock), the Fisher
  ideal index, the simple sum and the currency equivalent index of
  Rotemberg, Driscoll and Poterba (1995), each with the dual user-cost
  price index;
- [`dmai_compare()`](https://myaseen208.com/dmai/reference/dmai_compare.md):
  every method on the same data;
- [`dmai_user_cost()`](https://myaseen208.com/dmai/reference/dmai_user_cost.md):
  the user costs and weights of the components;
- [`dmai_moments()`](https://myaseen208.com/dmai/reference/dmai_moments.md):
  the Divisia second moments of Barnett and Serletis (1990);
- `ggplot2` graphics, a plain-language interpretation of every result
  ([`dmai_interpret()`](https://myaseen208.com/dmai/reference/dmai_interpret.md)),
  the references of every method
  ([`dmai_cite()`](https://myaseen208.com/dmai/reference/dmai_cite.md))
  and an application that runs all of this without code
  ([`dmai_app()`](https://myaseen208.com/dmai/reference/dmai_app.md)).

Version 1.0.0 keeps the function, arguments and results of version
0.5.0, with one correction: the growth `DMAI` now uses natural
logarithms by default, so it is a growth rate in percent (0.5.0 used
base 10, which gives 0.434 times that; `logbase = 10` reproduces it).
The package no longer depends on the tidyverse, and its index formulas
reproduce the published values of the Consumer Price Index Manual (ILO
et al. 2004, Chapter 19).

## Installation

``` r

install.packages("dmai")
# development version
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("myaseen208/dmai")
```

## Quick start

The example data `money_sim` are **simulated** monthly components of a
broad money aggregate with their rates and a benchmark rate (`rb`).

``` r

library(dmai)
data(money_sim)
fit <-
  dmai(
      .data     = money_sim
    , method    = "Barnett"
    , logbase   = NULL
    , date      = "Date"
    , x         = NULL
    , r         = NULL
    , user_cost = NULL
    , benchmark = "rb"
    , percent   = TRUE
    , base      = 100
    , as_dt     = FALSE
    )
fit
```

``` R

Divisia (Barnett) monetary aggregate

From 2005-01-01 to 2024-12-01 the Divisia (Barnett) aggregate grew 11.3% a
year, against 12.8% for the simple sum (1.6 points less).

Findings:
- Largest growth at 2009-03-01, 2021-12-01, 2024-01-01 (2.49, 2.24, 2.17);
  smallest at 2007-06-01, 2012-09-01, 2018-12-01 (-0.71, -0.67, -0.61).
- At the last date the largest weights are x3 (28.1%), x1 (19.5%), x2
  (18.8%).
- The weights moved most for x1 (32.3 to 19.5%), x4 (4.3 to 9.9%), x6 (3.7 to
  8.5%).
- The simple sum overstates money growth: it gives the same weight to
  interest-bearing deposits, which are held largely as savings, as to
  currency and demand deposits.

Recommendations:
- Compare the methods with dmai_compare(); check how the result depends on
  the benchmark rate.
- dmai_moments() shows when the components grow at very different rates.
